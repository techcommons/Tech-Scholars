 <p>Bessie Smith was a renowned Blues singer, known for her low 
 voice and expressive performance.  After some years of singing 
 and gaining popularity with an all-Black singing group, she earned
 a deal with Columbia Records.  She released her first song named
 "Downhearted Blues" with Columbia Records and it sold more than 
 500,000 copies within the first year of its release.  She began 
 to tour across America with her band, earning an estimated $2,000 per week, an 
 abundant amount of money for the time.  Throughout the years, she 
 performed passionately and soulfully in sold out shows.  
 The venues she performed in often requested that she and her band 
 stay for more performances.  Smith was one of the highest-paid 
 Black female artists in the country and was an essential part of 
 spreading the music genre of the Blues.

<p>Jessie Fauset was a popular writer and editor during the Harlem 
Renaissance.  One of her starting positions was as a writer for the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's magazine. 
She was soon promoted to be their literary editor.  Mainly, 
she helped initiate the careers of Lagnston Hughes and Anne Spencer 
by introducing them to a nationwide assembly.  They soon became 
primary writers of the Harlem Renaissance whose works are still 
highly popular and read today.  Fauset additionally published her 
own novels titled, There is Confusion and Comedy: American Style.  
Her literary works were about middle class African American 
families in America and their challenges of racial discrimination 
and prejudice.  She allowed for the world to experience the most 
influential authors of the Harlem Renaissance and shared with it
the obstacles of being an African American in the early 20th 
Century.
