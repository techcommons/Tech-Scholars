<h2>
The Untold Female Changemakers of the Harlem Renaissance</h2>
<p> The culturally rich and vibrant neighborhood of Harlem, New York 
became a harbor for many African Americans, as a result of the Great
Migration, during the 1920s and 1930s.  In this densely populated 
location, gathered some of the most talented individuals of 20th 
Century America, including authors, like Zora Neale Hurston, 
artists, like Aaron Douglas, and musicians, such as Josephine Baker 
and Ella Fitzgerald.  These skilled creatives helped for a cultural 
advancement to occur in which African American talent was widely viewed and 
celebrated, consequently resulting in a sensation of pride for their
important achievements.  Conversely, the Harlem Renaissance would not 
have been possible without the notable contributions of Bessie Smith 
and Jessie Fauset.
