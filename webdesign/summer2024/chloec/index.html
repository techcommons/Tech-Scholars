  <p class="homeText">Mexican artists are rarely recognized, especially not female Mexican artists besides Frida Kahlo. Despite this, Monica Mayers has been publishing unique, feminist works in various media- exhibitions in museums, performances, books, essays, and journals. Her most notable exhibition- El Tendedero/the Clothesline Project is an interesting take on a clothesline, considered a traditional job of laundry for a woman to do, where there are post its with different prompts, asking women to write about their experiences with sexual harassment and violence and their opinions on what preventive measures we should take. Each post it is displayed on the clothesline amongst numerous others, and is unique in every location that the exhibition is in.
