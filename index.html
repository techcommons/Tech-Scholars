        Exploring the intersection between history and technology, made by New

      <p>
        The New York Historical offers a robust suite of digital humanities
        programs for high school students year-round in the Tech Commons. These
        Tech Scholars programs center the student-led creation of digital
        projects, including podcasts, websites, and digital games through
        researching artists, historical figures, and events that continue to
        impact and inspire young people today.

        <h4>WEB DESIGN</h4>
        <p>
          Teens explore how women across the spectrum of race, class, and
          sexuality exercised power and effected change. They become digital
          changemakers and create their own websites to share powerful stories
          about women in history.

        <h4>GAME DESIGN</h4>
        <p>
          Teens create their own digital game based on history! They conduct
          research, conceptualize and create their own 2D game inspired by the
          collections at The New York Historical.

        <h4>PODCASTING</h4>
        <p>
          Teens collaborate with other teens to create a season of The New York
          Historical teen podcast. They hone skills in history, art, and
          technology as they research a topic; interview an expert; and write,
          record, and edit their own podcast episode!
