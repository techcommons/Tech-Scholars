                    Known for her great contributions in the math and tech field, Granville excelled in her 
                academics at a young age and even became the second African woman to ever earn a doctoral 
                degree in a math major. She earned her first degree at Smith College in 1945, but later earned 
                her doctoral degree in Yale University. Her first career kicked off by working as a mathematician 
                at different government agencies where she used her math knowledge to solve underlying 
                problems for the team. This first career also gave Granville the opportunity to find interest in 
                the tech world of scientific computing that she later grew more passionate about.
            </p>
            <p class = "paragraph">
                    Following her experience of working as a mathematician for different government 
                agencies, Granville joined IBM in 1956 as a contributor of computer software for NASA's 
                Project Vanguard. Her experienced skills in computational mathematics also motivated her to 
                work on orbit computations for Project Mercury, which she played a huge role in improving 
                space exploration using mathematical modeling and computer programming. Being a minority 
                herself, Granville has always made an effort to open resources for underrepresented groups in 
                STEM fields. She even mentored motivated mathematicians and scientists including women 
                and minorities, fostering STEM careers.

                    Above all, Granville's legend extended beyond the math and computer programming 
                field. She chose to continue pursuing education to benefit other minorities and open voices 
                from people of different backgrounds. Through her continued effort, Granville was able to
                 extend knowledge to people who were once unable to access those resources and participate in 
                a field that they would never have imagined. This legacy came to an end on June 27, 2023 after 
                she sadly passed away in her home when she was 99.
