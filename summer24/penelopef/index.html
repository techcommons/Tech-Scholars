    <h3>When we get sick, we call up our doctors. But what happens when our critter companions fall ill? That work is saved for veterinarians! Though animal medicine practices date back to before 9000 BC, it wasn't until the early 1900s that pets began to receive veterinary care. The growth of technological innovations naturally led to a shift in veterinary medicine; doctors began focusing more on smaller animals, such as dogs, cats, and rabbits, as opposed to livestock. In its early practice, veterinary medicine was not very friendly towards women. Despite this, many women challenged the status quo at the time, such as Dr. Jane Hinton and Dr. Patricia O'Connor, and paved the way for more women and innovation in the sector. As of December 2023, 67% of veterinarians are women! Click the information tab to learn more about the revolutionary work that both Dr. Jane Hinton and Dr. Patricia O'Connor accomplished.</h3>
