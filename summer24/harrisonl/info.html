        <p>Born in 1936 in Paoli, Indiana, Margaret Hamilton initially pursued a degree in mathematics from Earlham College. After graduating in 1958, she moved to Boston with her husband and daughter, where she learned about computers and software engineering. Working at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, she contributed to the SAGE project, a pioneering air defense system. This early experience laid the foundation for her future contributions to space exploration and software development. In 1960 after John F. Kennedy announced his goal to land American men on the moon, NASA contracted MIT to develop and test flight navigation and landing software. When Hamilton heard the news, she just thought, "Wow, I've got to go there." She became the first computer programmer and first female to join NASA's Apollo project.</p>
        <p>Margaret Hamilton faced numerous barriers as a woman in the predominantly male field of computer programming during the 1960s and 1970s. Despite her groundbreaking contributions, she often encountered skepticism and condescension from her male colleagues and superiors, who questioned her capabilities simply because of her gender. She said, "When I took over, one of the bosses at the top said he had no doubt I could do the job but was worried the men working in the group might rebel." In an era when women were rarely seen in technical leadership roles, Hamilton had to continually prove her expertise and assert her authority in a field that was not yet accustomed to female engineers. Balancing her demanding career with her responsibilities as a mother added another layer of challenge, as societal expectations often placed domestic duties squarely on women.</p>
        <p>Beyond her contributions to the Apollo program, Margaret Hamilton's legacy includes coining the term "software engineering" to emphasize the discipline and professionalism required in the field. In 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc., where she continued to innovate in software development. Her numerous accolades, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by President Barack Obama in 2016, underscore her profound impact on technology and space exploration. "She symbolizes that generation of unsung women who helped send humankind into space," said President Obama. Hamilton's pioneering spirit and dedication have left an indelible mark on computer science, inspiring generations of engineers and programmers.</p>
