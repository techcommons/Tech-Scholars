   <h3>Early Life & Time in Congress</h2>
   
   <p> As a child, Bella Abzug was described as very outspoken and serious. In her school years, she was a stellar student, which led her to a scholarship for Columbia Law. Female law students were very rare. After graduating, she started her own law firm that commonly dealt with civil rights cases, such as defending victims of racial prejudice. Later, she began her career in politics. She ran and secured a seat in the House of Representatives. She was the first woman from New York to do so. She was one of 12 women in the House. During her time in the House, she was an effective legislature, authoring and sponsoring many impactful bills. For example, The Equality Act of 1974. This was the first Federal Bill that protected gay and lesbian people from being discriminated against. She also authored Title IX, an act that prohibited discrimination in educational programs/activities based on sex. Her colleagues had voted her as the third most influential US House Congresswoman. In her 6 years as a Congresswoman, she had raised roughly  6 billion dollars for New York State.</p>
   
   <h3>Work outside of the Office</h2>

   </em></p>
   
    <p>Not only had Abzug taken initiative in the office, but she also did outside of it. Other than planning her campaign for mayor of New York City, she also founded numerous organizations. She founded Women USA, a grassroots political organization. In 1977, Abzug, along with other influential feminists, planned the National Women's Conference. By the end of the four-day conference, a policy plan was formulated. This plan advocated for accessible abortions and the inclusion of LGBTQ women in the feminist movement. She attended and led numerous marches and protests for a variety of causes. Things such as women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and in the opposition of the Vietnam War.</p>

   <h3>Her Effect</h2>
  
   <p>Abzug died in 1998. Her death affected many across the world. The effects of her efforts are still felt today. She faced many challenges, including pressure to stop her efforts in her strive for equality. In the time of the 70s and 80s, people working towards a liberal agenda were often looked down upon and met with opposition. However, "Battling Bella" as she was nicknamed, preserved and opened the gates to show the world all that a woman can do.</p>
