  <h1>The Impact of Southeast and South Asian Women Artists on American Art History</h1>
    <p>In the 20th century, we have seen the rise of representation in the world of history, especially for those of Asian-American heritage and women. This has been proven to be a major breakthrough in the field of history, as  Americans are able to see their history from a new and fresh perspective. However, many museums fail to include women of different diasporas in Asia, such as South and Southeast Asia. While there are many accomplished artists of these ethnicities, the artists shown today are only a fraction of the many contributions of women in the industry. </p>

    <h2>Why is it so important to represent those of undermined communities?</h2>
    <p>Sharing the voices of those in undermined communities allows for culture to be preserved and attempts to correct many marginalizations in history. It also allows communities to feel empowered and take pride in their heritage. Representing those in undermined communities that also promote diversity.</p>
